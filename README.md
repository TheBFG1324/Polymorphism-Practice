# Polymorphism-Practice
A Python and Go project demonstrating modular and extensible code through a racing simulation system involving different types of vehicles. The project highlights object-oriented programming concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, abstract classes, and method overriding in Python, while leveraging Go's idiomatic design principles, including interfaces and composition, to achieve similar functionality.
